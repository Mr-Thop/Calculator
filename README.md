# Calculator Program

## Overview
This is a simple Java-based calculator program that allows users to perform various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, Fibonacci sequence computation, and statistical calculations like mean, variance, and standard deviation.

## Files
The project consists of three main files:
- **Main.java**: Handles the main execution flow and user interaction.
- **UserInput.java**: Manages user input and operation selection.
- **Calculator.java**: Contains methods to perform calculations.

## Functionalities

### Main.java
- Initializes scanner and instances of `UserInput` and `Calculator`.
- Runs a loop to take user input and select operations.
- Calls `UserInput.handleOperation()` to process user choices.

### UserInput.java
Handles user input and selects the appropriate calculation method.

#### Methods:
- **handleOperation(int choice, Calculator calculator)**: Uses a switch-case to determine which operation to perform based on user input.
  - Takes two numbers as input for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Takes a single number for the Fibonacci sequence.
  - Takes an array for sum, mean, variance, and standard deviation calculations.

### Calculator.java
Contains mathematical operations.

#### Methods:
- **double add(double a, double b)**: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- **double subtract(double a, double b)**: Returns the difference of two numbers.
- **double multiply(double a, double b)**: Returns the product of two numbers.
- **double divide(double a, double b)**: Returns the quotient of two numbers (handles division by zero).
- **int fibonacci(int n)**: Returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
- **double sumArray(double[] arr)**: Returns the sum of all elements in the array.
- **double mean(double[] arr)**: Returns the mean (average) of the array elements.
- **double variance(double[] arr)**: Computes and returns the variance of the array.
- **double standardDeviation(double[] arr)**: Computes and returns the standard deviation of the array.

## Usage
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation.
3. Provide input values as prompted.
4. View the result displayed on the console.

## Exit
To exit the program, enter `10` when prompted for an operation selection.
